- type: entity
  name: laser beam segment
  id: BeamLaser # This is referenced by ConstantLaserGun's EffectPrototype
  parent: BaseEntity # Minimal parent
  noSpawn: true # Typically true for entities spawned programmatically by systems
  components:
  - type: Transform # Explicitly add if BaseEntity doesn't guarantee it (it usually does)
  - type: Sprite
    sprite: Effects/beam.rsi # Placeholder sprite for a beam segment
    state: red_beam # A specific state, e.g., for a red laser
    netsync: false # Visuals are usually not net-synced like this directly
    # Shaders can be applied here if desired, e.g., "unshaded"
  - type: Beam # The BeamComponent itself. This is Content.Shared.Beam.Components.SharedBeamComponent essentially.
    # No sound here, as the ConstantLaserGun or controller will handle continuous sounds.
  - type: TimedDespawn
    lifetime: 0.2 # Segments should despawn quickly if orphaned. Controller manages overall beam.
  # No PhysicsComponent here; BeamSystem will add its own specialized fixture & physics to segments.
  # If segments had their own colliders, it could interfere.
